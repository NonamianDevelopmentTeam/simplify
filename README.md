# NDT Simplify
In the past, we have often found that many people do not create games because they don't have enough time in their busy lives. This library, built on [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), is made to remedy this problem. It is created to speed up the game programming process and to make it more efficient. It is designed for our own use, but you can use it too, just download it [here](https://nonamiandevteam.000webhostapp.com/simplify/download/).
NDT Simplify is in active development. If you find any errors, please [contact us](https://nonamiandevteam.000webhostapp.com/contact-info.html). You can also contact us to request features and whatnot, basically if you want to say anything about the library.
